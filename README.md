## Testing

### HTML and CSS testing
 The HTML and CSS code was tested using the W3C Validation Service. Both has passed with no errors.

### JavaScript testing 
 The JavaScript code was tested using Jshint. There were too many "Unnecessary semicolon" errors, which was fixed.

### Functionality testing 
 I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.
